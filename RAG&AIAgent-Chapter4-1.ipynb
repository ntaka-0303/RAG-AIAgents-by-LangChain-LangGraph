\\n・水………………………………600～700ml  \\n・市販カレールウ………………1箱（約200～220g）  \\n・ウスターソース………………大さじ1  \\n・ケチャップ……………………大さじ1  \\n・はちみつ（または砂糖）……小さじ1  \\n・塩・こしょう…………………適量  \\n\\n■下ごしらえ  \\n1. 牛肉に軽く塩・こしょうを振って10分ほど置く。  \\n2. 玉ねぎは薄切り、にんじんは乱切り、じゃがいもは一口大に切り、水にさらしてアクを抜く。  \\n\\n■作り方  \\n1. 鍋を中火で熱し、サラダ油を入れてにんにく・生姜を炒める。香りが立ったら玉ねぎを加え、透き通るまでじっくり炒める（約8分）。  \\n2. 牛肉を加え、表面の色が変わるまで炒める。にんじん・じゃがいもも加えてさらに1分ほど炒め合わせる。  \\n3. 水をひたひた（材料が軽く隠れる程度）まで注ぎ入れ、煮立ったらアクを取り、蓋をして中火で約15分煮る。  \\n4. 火を弱め、いったん火を止めてルウを割り入れ、溶け残しがないように混ぜる。  \\n5. 再び弱火～中火にかけ、とろみがつくまで約10分ほど煮込む。焦げ付かないようときどき混ぜる。  \\n6. ウスターソース、ケチャップ、はちみつを加えてひと煮立ちさせ、塩・こしょうで味を調えて火を止める。  \\n\\n■ポイント・アレンジ  \\n- コクを出したい場合は、炒める際にバター10gを加えてもOK。  \\n- スパイス好きなら、市販ルウのほかにカレー粉小さじ1～2をプラスしても風味がアップします。  \\n- 野菜はピーマンやナスなどお好みで追加しても。  \\n- 煮込み時間を長くするとさらにまろやかになります。  \\n\\nご飯にかけて、福神漬けやらっきょうを添えれば、日本の定番カレーの完成です。お楽しみください！' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 935, 'prompt_tokens': 27,
